  headline: New Solar-Powered Innovation Developed
  tagline: 
  excerpts: "Scientists have recently developed the most compact solar technology
    in history - panels as small as a square centimeter that can produce up to 1kWh
    of energy per day. This is a monumental breakthrough in clean energy technology,
    and companies are already taking notice.\r\nFor instance, there are reports of
    fashion industry giants - specifically Victoria\u2019s Secret and Toyota - already
    planning lines for the new season that incorporate these new solar panels. Projected
    uses include using the solar panels as jewelry and substitutes for sequins.\r\nThe
    Eco-Catholic Coalition has also shown an interest in using the panels in the stained
    glass mosaics for their upcoming mega-cathedrals in New Los Angeles and Chicago.
    Excess energy generated by these mosaics will be donated to local homeless shelters
    and disadvantaged androids."
