  headline: Life Found in the Australian Wastelands
  tagline: Remote probes have picked up signs of life.
  excerpts: "The wastelands of Australia have been uninhabitable for nearly two hundred
    years\u2026 Or so we\u2019ve thought.\r\nLast week, remote probes left in place
    by scientists before the final evacuation of the Australian Exodus have detected
    signs of human life. It is unclear how they have survived, though the leading
    academic theory is that a small community fled underground before the mass evacuations.
    Drone squads are currently being mobilized, and will be ready to further investigate
    within the month.\r"
