  excerpts: "- A brand new \u201CGold Rush\u201D occurs.\r\nA plethora of people have
    scrambled over to the new underwater city, paying a lot of money for people to
    take them to the new site in hopes of finding amazing treasure.\r\nMany people
    are actually quitting their jobs, clinging onto the small hope that they could
    strike it big.\r\nWorld governments also take notice and start bickering and fighting
    amongst themselves.\r\nUnbeknownst to everyone, the people who went in search
    of treasure never returned, people begin speculating if there might be someone
    or something guarding it\r\n"
