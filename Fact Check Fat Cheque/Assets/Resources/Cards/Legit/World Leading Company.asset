  headline: 'World Leading Company Has Secret/Scandalous Partnership  '
  tagline: 
  excerpts: "A World Leading Company, Innovation X, formerly known to have made billions
    of dollars by offering amazing tech support and \u201Cinnovative\u201D designs
    for engineers has recently been discovered to have partnered up with an underground
    trade system in which illegal weapons, drugs, and people are traded.\r\nInnovation
    X is denying it vehemently, but all the evidence (Phone calls, email messages,
    etc.) is against them.\r\nThe underground trade system is actually not making
    any statements and letting Innovation X take the fall.\r\nTrading illegal_weapons
    increases animosity and ill_will.\r\nTrading drugs decreases overall healthy state
    of the world\r\nTrading people (in this case, it can be either for \u2018slave-usage\u2019
    or women) would increase ill will and WORLD_POPULATION\r\n"
