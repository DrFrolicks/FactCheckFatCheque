  excerpts: "Engineers at a startup company, Tokyo Trouble Tortilla, have designed
    a vehicle that allows the user to initiate the vehicle using purely emotional
    stress.\r\nThe vehicle just got out of its testing phase and many people are jumping
    on the hype train.\r\nThe vehicle is actually forcing people to be stressed so
    they can power it and not pay for gas.\r\nPeople\u2019s toxicity and ill_will
    rises due to being stressed all the time\r\nEventually, ill_will will peak and
    people will start attacking/killing each oth\r\n"
