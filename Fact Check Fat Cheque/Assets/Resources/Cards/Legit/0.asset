  headline: New Solar-Powered Innovation Developed
  tagline: 
  excerpts: "\u201C\u2018We have recently developed the most compact solar technology
    in history,\u2019 says environmental scientist Doctor Shah. \u2018Panels as small
    as a square centimeter that can produce up to 1kWh of energy per day!\u201D\u2019\r\n\u201CAnonymous
    sources from within the fashion industry have revealed interest in incorporating
    these mini-panels in the upcoming season as jewelry and sequin substitutes.\u201D\r\n\u201CThe
    Eco-Catholic Church has also shown an interest in using the panels in the stained
    glass mosaics for their upcoming mega-cathedrals in New Los Angeles and Chicago.
    Excess energy generated by these mosaics will be donated to local homeless shelters
    and disadvantaged androids.\u201D"
  comments: "\u201Cthisll be a big money saver for me! my energy bill is always through
    the roof lol\u201D || 5\r\n\u201CSupporting androids?! The Eco-Caths really have
    been going downhill recently\u2026 Might be time to switch to a denomination that
    knows where those metal bastards belong.\u201D || -7"
