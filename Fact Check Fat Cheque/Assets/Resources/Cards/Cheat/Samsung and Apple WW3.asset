  excerpts: "The \u201Ccold war\u201D is finally coming to an end between the two
    powerhouses as they prepare for an all out brawl. For many decades, they have
    been shooting insults back and forth and trying to outperform each other, but
    they now realize that there\u2019s only one way it can end.\r\nPeople rally to
    one side or the other and start developing weapons of mass destruction\r\nApple
    throws shade at Samsung, saying, \u201CDon\u2019t use your exploding phones as
    weapons.\u201D\r\nSamsung retaliates with, \u201CSorry, we can\u2019t hear you
    without your headphone jack.\u201D\r\nApple responds with, \u201CRemember when
    the stylus died? Apparently you guys didn\u2019t get the memo.\u201D\r\nSamsung
    retaliates with, \u201CRemember when Steve Jobs died?\u201D\r\nHow will this age-old
    rivalry end up affecting the rest of the world?\r\n"
