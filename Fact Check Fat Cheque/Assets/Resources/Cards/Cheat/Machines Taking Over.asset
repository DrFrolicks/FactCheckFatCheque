  headline: 'Are the Machines Taking Over? - Androids take control of the .01% '
  tagline: BIGOTRY
  excerpts: "The android uprising is finally upon us. An L3X 3500 unit, publicly known
    as Alexander Grant, has been voted as head of the World Food Corporation\u2019s
    board. This L3X 3500 unit has no place running the very corporation that we humans
    rely upon for food - he doesn\u2019t even need to eat!\r\nWhich, of course, begs
    the question: why would he be put in charge of this position that is so vital
    for human survival? Why would he be interested in it in the first place?\r\nThe
    answer is, of course, that we are witnessing the first steps in an android plot
    to overtake the human race. The masses are simply too blinded to recognize it
    for what it is.\r\nStay alert, friends. Stay alert, and stay critical. We cannot
    take this lying down.\r\n"
