New Solar-Powered Innovation Developed
@@
“‘We have recently developed the most compact solar technology in history,’ says environmental scientist Doctor Shah. ‘Panels as small as a square centimeter that can produce up to 1kWh of energy per day!”’
“Anonymous sources from within the fashion industry have revealed interest in incorporating these mini-panels in the upcoming season as jewelry and sequin substitutes.”
“The Eco-Catholic Church has also shown an interest in using the panels in the stained glass mosaics for their upcoming mega-cathedrals in New Los Angeles and Chicago. Excess energy generated by these mosaics will be donated to local homeless shelters and disadvantaged androids.”

Life Found in the Australian Wastelands - Remote probes have picked up signs of life.
@@
The wastelands of Australia have been uninhabitable for nearly two hundred years… Or so we’ve thought.
Last week, remote probes left in place by scientists before the final evacuation of the Australian Exodus have detected signs of human life. It is unclear how they have survived, though the leading academic theory is that a small community fled underground before the mass evacuations. Drone squads are currently being mobilized, and will be ready to further investigate within the month.
